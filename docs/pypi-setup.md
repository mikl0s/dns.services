1. Create a PyPI Account:

   - Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/
   - Click "Add API token"
   - Name it something like "GitHub Actions Upload Token"
   - Set scope to "Entire account (all projects)"
   - Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again)

3. Add Token to GitHub:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: PYPI_API_TOKEN
   - Value: (paste the token you copied from PyPI)
   - Click "Add secret"

4. Test the Setup:

   - The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
     - Run tests across all supported Python versions
     - Build the package
     - Upload to PyPI if all tests pass
